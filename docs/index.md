## Overview

**PettingLLMs** is an open-source framework for **on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-agent large language models (LLMs)**.  

It implements **AT-GRPO** (Agent- and Turn-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm and system design for training collaborative LLM agents across **planning, coding, and mathematical reasoning tasks**.

## Supported Training Modes

This framework supports:

- ✅ **Single-agent RL training**  
- ✅ **Multi-agent RL training (role-sharing policy)**  
- ✅ **Multi-agent RL training (role-specialized policies using different LoRA adapters or different LLMs)**  

## 📰 News

- **[2025.10]** 🚀 GitHub repository open-sourced and publicly available
- **[2025.10]** 🎉 Paper released! Check out our [arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11062)
- **[2025.10]** 🔥 Support for different LoRA adapters per agent role - enabling efficient role-specialized training
- **[2025.09]** 🌍 Multi-environment support added: Game (Sudoku, Sokoban), Code (APPS, CodeContests), and Math (AIME, OlympiadBench)
- **[2025.08]** 🤖 Multi-agent framework implementation: support for both shared single model and role-specific models

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.git
cd PettingLLMs
bash setup.bash
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Dataset Preparation

Prepare datasets for different tasks:

```bash
# Code tasks (APPS, CodeContests, LiveCodeBench)
python scripts/dataprocess/load_code.py

# Math tasks (AIME24/25, OlympiadBench)
python scripts/dataprocess/load_math.py

# Game/Planning tasks (Sokoban, Sudoku)
python scripts/dataprocess/load_sokoban.py
```

Datasets will be saved to `datasets/code/`, `datasets/math/`, and `datasets/sudoku_environments/`.

### 2. Training

**Example: Train multi-agent system on math tasks**

```bash
bash scripts/train/math/math_L1_prompt.sh
```

Other training scripts available in `scripts/train/`:
- `code_single_policy.sh`, `code_two_policy.sh` - Code domain
- `plan_path_single.sh`, `plan_path_two_policy.sh` - Planning domain
- `sokoban_two_policy.sh`, `sokodu_single.sh` - Game domain

### 3. Evaluation

**Example: Evaluate trained model**

Edit `scripts/evaluate/evaluate.sh` to set your model path and config:
```bash
MODEL_PATHS=("/path/to/your/model")
CONFIG_NAME="math_single_policy"
```

Then run:
```bash
bash scripts/evaluate/evaluate.sh
```

## 🧱 Three Levels of Agent Specialization

PettingLLMs uses a tiered approach to define agent roles, ranging from simple instructions to deep model specialization.

| Level | Role Specialization Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L0** | **Shared model** | Roles are defined *solely through instructions* in the prompt. The base model is identical for all agents, offering a flexible but performance-limited baseline. |
| **L1** | **LoRA** | Each role is specialized using a unique, lightweight **LoRA adapter**. This creates distinct, cost-effective agent "personalities" on top of a shared base model. |
| **L2** | **Full-Model** | The **entire model's weights** are optimized for a specific role using reinforcement learning. This creates a highly specialized expert agent for maximum performance on complex tasks. |
